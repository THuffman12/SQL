# For this project I used SQL to query the superstore database to find information about products sold at the store.

# Use a SELECT statement to pull up all information in the table for reference.
SELECT *
FROM superstore;

#Use a SELECT statement to order items by price.
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

#Show a statistic (AVG) about item prices. 
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic (AVG) price of items in category 'Kitchen Supplies'.
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies';

#Check inventory for stock_quanitiy of specific item 
SELECT category, item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
